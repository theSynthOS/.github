# Hi there üëã

# SynthOS - Verifiable DeFAI Agent Marketplace
## üëÄWhat is SynthOS?
SynthOS is a verifiable DeFAI agent marketplace where users create no-code AI agents, and investors select policy-validated, automated yield strategies tailored to their risk appetite.

## üìåProduct Description
### ‚ÄºÔ∏èProblem Statement

SynthOS aims to solve key challenges in the DeFAI automation space:

- **Lack of verifiability**Ôºö 
AI agents operate as black boxes with no transparency.

- **Limited user control**Ôºö
No modular framework for setting execution rules.

- **High barriers to automation**Ôºö
Current solutions are complex and non-intuitive.

### üéØVision
A decentralized AI agent economy where users can create, customize, and monetize verifiable DeFi automation without security risks.

### üö®Unique Value Proposition
A policy-based AVS framework powered by Autonome & Othentic.¬†

## ‚öíÔ∏èHow it's Made?
SynthOS enables users to deploy AI agents with predefined execution rules while secure agent actions with Eigen Layer validators and utilize Scroll for low-latency, gas optimized transactions.

## The Stack
1. Frontend - Next.JS, TailwindCSS, React, Javascript, Typescript
2. UI Library - DaisyUI, Aceternity UI
3. Web3 Development - Solidity, Foundry, ThirdWeb

# SynthOS Smart Contracts

### SynthOS is a Verifiable DeFAI Agent Marketplace that implements a cross-chain policy validation system between Base and Scroll networks. The system enables secure validation of agent transactions against predefined policies across different chains.

## Overview

The Policy-based Transaction Validation AVS is a decentralized framework that enables the validation of blockchain transactions against predefined policies. It leverages the Othentic Stack to provide a secure and transparent validation mechanism.

The system consists of four main smart contracts:

1. **PolicyRegistry.sol**

   - Manages the registration and storage of policies
   - Defines rules and constraints for agent actions
   - Handles policy lifecycle (creation, activation, deactivation)

2. **AgentRegistry.sol**

   - Manages agent registration and metadata
   - Links agents to their associated policies
   - Tracks agent status and capabilities

3. **PolicyCoordinator.sol**

   - Core contract for transaction validation
   - Coordinates between agents and their policies
   - Validates transactions against time, function, and resource constraints
   - Receives cross-chain messages from Base network
   - Deployed on Scroll Sepolia

4. **CrosschainSender.sol**
   - Handles cross-chain communication from Base to Scroll
   - Integrates with Hyperlane for secure message passing
   - Acts as an AVS Logic hook for task validation
   - Deployed on Base Sepolia

### Cross-Chain Flow
