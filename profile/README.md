# SynthOS

Composable yield bundles across DeFi and beyond.

SynthOS is a financial intelligence + execution layer that helps you construct, understand, and deploy diversified yield exposure from a single interface.

Instead of limiting you to “on-chain interest rates,” SynthOS lets you mix and match yield strategies across any asset class on-chain, off-chain, or hybrid so long as they can be represented as **vault primitives** and brought onto **SynthOS**.

Build your own bundle, follow others, and use SynthOS intelligence to make better decisions then execute the plan with minimal operational overhead.

## Core Messages

### 1) Mix & match any yield strategy as vault primitives (SynthOS)
SynthOS treats yield sources as standardized **vault primitives** that act as composable building blocks you can combine into a single bundle.

This enables exposure to many strategy types through one interface, including (but not limited to):
- interest rate strategies
- swap-fee / LP fee capture
- market making and liquidity provisioning
- structured strategies
- tokenized real-world yield (where available)

If a yield stream can be expressed as a vault primitive, it can be surfaced, compared, and bundled on SynthOS.

### 2) Build your own bundle (and optionally invest socially)
You can construct a bundle that reflects how you actually allocate:
- across strategy types, protocols, and chains
- across assets and risk intents
- across multiple vault primitives in one portfolio

Social investing is supported as a concept:
- discover bundles created by others
- follow, copy, or “fork” a bundle configuration and tailor it to your own risk intent

### 3) Financial intelligence that improves decisions, then helps execute
SynthOS is not just a strategy directory. It is designed to help you:
- understand tradeoffs (risk, liquidity, protocol quality, correlation, volatility)
- choose better combinations and allocations
- execute deposits/allocations with fewer steps (routing, swaps, bridging, approvals)

Rebalancing is currently **user-executed**: SynthOS can surface monitoring insights and rebalance suggestions, but the user chooses whether to submit the rebalance transaction.

## How SynthOS Works

### Vault primitives on SynthOS
SynthOS is the strategy layer where yield sources are represented as vault primitives. SynthOS consumes these primitives to power:
- bundle construction
- strategy comparison and filtering
- allocation planning and execution

### AI strategy intelligence
SynthOS includes an AI analyzer that personalizes opportunities based on your wallet activity, preferences, and risk intent. It helps you construct a more robust plan than simple APY chasing.

### Your Vault
When you create a Vault, you are creating a **personal smart-contract vault** that tracks positions and portfolio logic. Your wallet is used for sign-in and approvals.

### Wallet model and execution
SynthOS supports social login and EOA wallets. A smart-wallet execution flow can be used to streamline multi-step actions (swaps, bridging, routing, approvals) and support a smoother cross-chain experience.

## Features

- Composable Bundle Builder (mix & match)
  Build a custom bundle across multiple vault primitives and asset classes.

- Single Strategy Investing
  Prefer a single vault primitive? Allocate directly into individual strategies.

- AI Copilot (financial intelligence)
  Personalized insights, risk-aware strategy discovery, and allocation guidance.

- Cross-chain ready execution
  Reduce operational friction for multi-step entry/exit flows (swaps, bridging, routing, approvals).

- Monitoring + rebalance suggestions (user-executed)
  Track allocation drift and receive suggested adjustments; you decide when to execute.

- Non-custodial by default
  You remain in control. Funds move only with your approvals.

## Fees & Incentives

SynthOS uses a transparent fee and incentive structure, disclosed in-product before you act. Fees may include:
- performance fees (on successful outcomes, where applicable)
- management fees (for active portfolio services, where applicable)

Incentives may include partner rewards, referrals, and participation points.

---

## Points

SynthOS Points track participation across the protocol (e.g., using recommendations, depositing/withdrawing, referrals, and partner interactions). Points may be used for future rewards and early access.

---

## Security & Risk

SynthOS is designed to prioritize transparency and risk awareness, but DeFi and tokenized strategies carry risk:
- smart contract risk (both SynthOS contracts and underlying protocols)
- market and volatility risk
- liquidity and withdrawal risk
- governance and parameter-change risk

Nothing here is financial advice. Always do your own research and only allocate what you can afford to deploy on-chain.
